# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Piero group project (Project Name pending), is a web based recipe and food pantry app. The app will allow users to select the actual food items they have in their pantry on a website which will then help find recipes based on the ingredients available. Our app will be geared towards families that have little time to sit, plan, and discover recipes on their own. This application saves them time and effort in asking the age old question, "What are we going to have for dinner?"

### Features

#### User Login: 
Users will have the ability to create an account on our web application. This will allow them to create and track their own virtual pantry.

#### Recipe Search:
Users will be able to search the integrated API for specific recipes and know exactly whether or not they have all the ingredients necessary to make it.

#### Recipe Filtering:
Users will be able to sort the recipes they find from the integrated API based on different preferences (cooking time, meal type, cuisine, etc.).

#### Ingredient Search:
Users will be able to search for specific ingredients to add them to their personal pantry.

### Technologies
Angular 8, 
JavaScript, 
Bootstrap CSS, 
Spring Boot, 
Firebase SAAS, 
SQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn best practices in maintaining user authentication data, including login information and linking databases to specific user accounts (to use for the pantry management part of the app). In addition, I will need to learn how to incorporate web based APIs for use in web application projects.
